### 🛠️ Key Activities

1. **User Interface Development**: Build a clean, responsive, and interactive UI using a frontend framework. Integrate a rich text editor (e.g., Quill.js) for editing.

2. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Implement WebSocket communication using **Socket.IO**. Ensure multiple users can edit the same document and see updates instantly.

3. **Backend Development**: Create RESTful APIs to fetch and update documents. Handle WebSocket events for broadcasting changes and saving content.

4. **Data Persistence**: Store documents in a database with unique IDs. Ensure autosaving at regular intervals.

5. **Project Structuring & Integration**: Maintain a clean separation between frontend and backend logic. Ensure consistent communication between components.
